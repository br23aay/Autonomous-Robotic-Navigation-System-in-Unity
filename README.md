# Autonomous Robot Navigation in Unity  
**Developer: Bharadwaj Rachuri**  
**Score Achieved: 100/100**

This project demonstrates an autonomous navigation controller developed in Unity using C#.  
The robot navigates a complex track featuring corners, obstacles and angled surfaces using  
a custom sensor-driven control system.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The aim of this project was to design and implement a fully autonomous robotic navigation  
system capable of completing a track without collisions. The behaviour was developed entirely  
within the `RobotController.cs` file, following strict module requirements.

The robot successfully completed the full course with stable control, smooth steering and  
robust obstacle avoidance — earning a **perfect score (100/100)**.
